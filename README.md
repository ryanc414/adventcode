Advent of Code 2020
-------------------

Here are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2020 challenge, written in Rust.

Most solution programs take an input filepath to load data from. For most
solutions both a `basic_input.txt` and a `full_input.txt` input files are
copied here - the basic input serves as a simplified test and the full input
is the real challenge input.

Every solution has a test that can be run individually with `cargo test` or
altogether with the `test_all.sh` script.
